This test runs successfully on postgres 9.6 installed on ubuntu, with database user 'postgres'.

It assumes there is a table.csv data file from our tpch lineitem table, csv of various sizes.

It also assumes there are 2 separate storage devices, with at least 400GB each.
/dev/sda4 # an hdd 
/dev/sdc  # an ssd

It assumes those dirs are owned by OS user 'postgres' who also has sudo privileges.

Running the create.ddl file with psql will create the tablespaces and tables and copy data into the tables.

Further details are in the create.ddl file.

After the tables are loaded, copy these files to the run dir:
all queries files (q*)
pg-bench.sh
runscript.sh

The runscript should be invoked by OS user 'postgres' with sudo as follows:
sudo sh runscript.sh <tablename>

This will run a loop of each query (q*) 3x, on tablename (e.g., lineitem1bssd).
For additional table names please see those listed in create.ddl
